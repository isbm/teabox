This is a content of a text file, called "helloworld.txt" and
therefore it contains extra data that does not need to be added to the
YAML file directly. This very file was just loaded into the UI.

Normally you should keep it till 80 characters wrapped so it will
usually fit into most terminals. If you need more features, you can
always open a pull request! :-)
