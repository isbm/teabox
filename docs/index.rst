The Concept
-----------

You have a lot of various setup scripts, that are meant to setup or configure
something. One way to keep them all around is to write a lengthy documentation
with the detailed description how to use them. This assumes that a user will
first carefully read the documentation, study the topic, fully learn the purpose
of that, and then use the software.

Another way is to give a user quick possibility to just go "Next/Next/NextFinish",
especially if a particular task is done once or maybe twice per year or even rarely.

The Teabox is doing exactly that: apart of providing a GUI to the variety of those
command line commands, it also sorts them into a meaningful organised system.


Use Case
--------

Create a setup or configuration tooling via variety of different commands, integrating
them into one system, and provide a unified UI.
